# website-hairdresser-mscice

My first commercial project. Simple one-page website. Made for a hairdressing salon that did not have one before.
Design created independently on the basis of own knowledge and the dependence of choosing colors, font styles, contrast, etc.

Technologies used by me for the first time:
1. Saas - Scss - 7-1
2. Bem
3. Html
4. CSS flexbox and grid used in practice
5. RWD
6. JS - very simple scripts
7. Git
8. Gulp along with sourucemaps
9. Webp format image
10. Google lightohouse
11. Seo basics (metatags, title etc)

The project was the first attempt to use BEM and Scss terminology. I've made a lot of mistakes here, and I can see things I could do a lot better, especially when it comes to class naming and scss file organization. The project is commercial, so I will probably slowly refactor the code as the site updates. At this point, I decided to go further and use the knowledge in future projects.

The code on github contains a set of scss files and the gulp configuration.
